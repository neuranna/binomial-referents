# Analysis

Supporting code for the main analyses can be found in two notebooks: Binomials Analysis 1 and Binomials Analysis 2. 

Sections contained in "Binomials Analysis 1":
- data preprocessing for the RSA models
- prior preferences (fig.)
- behavioral vs. model-predicted order and size preferences (fig.)

Sections contained in "Binomials Analysis 2":
- data preprocessing for mixed effect regression analyses in R
- data preprocessing for estimating prior preferences in R
- prediction plots for models vs. participants (fig.)
- setup for demonstrating size and order effect on specific examples (fig.)
