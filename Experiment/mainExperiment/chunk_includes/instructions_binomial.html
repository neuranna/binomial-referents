	<h3 style="color:blue;"> Task instructions </h3>

	<p>In another experiment, we present participants with an image of a pair of objects and ask them to name the objects. 
	We then get response phrases such as <i>"car and road"</i>.</p> 
	<p>Here, we will show you ten examples of these phrases. 
	After each phrase, we will show you with three images of object pairs that the speaker might have been referring to. 
	We will then ask you to decide which of these three images the speaker most likely had in mind.</p> 
	<p>In some cases, we do not get a response phrase for an object pair from a participant, due to technical difficulties.  
	We will show these cases as <i>"xxxxxxxxxxx"</i> and will ask you to guess to the best of your ability. </p>
